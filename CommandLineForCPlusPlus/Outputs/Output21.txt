Joseph Pulitzer was born in 1847

in Maké, Hungary. He immigrated
to the United States when he

was seventeen years old, and

was naturalized on his twentieth
birthday. He spent his career in
journalism working in the mid-West
and New York. From 1871 he was
also the owner or part-owner of
many newspapers. His most famous
newspaper was the New York World
(which many believe was the model
for the Daily Planet of the Superman
stories). The New York World
campaigned against corruption, and
exposed many scandals. It was also
a strong supporter of the rights of the
working man.

In later life, Joseph Pulitzer became
dedicated to improving the quality
of journalism in America, and donated
$1 million to Columbia University
to found a school ofjournalism.
However, his most signiﬁcant
contribution was the establishment
of the Pulitzer prizes in his will.
These prizes for excellence in
journalism have been given every
year since 1917 by Columbia
University. Since 1942 there

have been extra categories for

press photography, and later still
for criticism, feature writing

and commentary. The prize was
originally for $500, but today the
winners of the prize receive a gold
medal.
