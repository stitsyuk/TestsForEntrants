correct answer for each question
below (29—31).

Recent scientiﬁc studies about
hedgehogs have helped to explain
mysteries as varied as why hedgehogs
apply saliva to their entire bodies,
how they have survived on the planet
for 30 million years, why they chew
toxic toad skins and what secrets
they may hold about evolution. As
one of the most primitive mammals
on the planet, the hedgehog has

been helping geneticists understand
evolutionary relationships among
mammals and even uncover secrets
of the human genome.

Hedgehogs spend much time alone.
But it would be a mistake to consider
them solitary. They may occasionally
scrap over food items and rival males
attracted to a female may also have
aggressive interactions. Still, it’s fair
to say that, in adulthood, hedgehogs
meet primarily to mate, producing
litters of four or ﬁve hoglets as often
as twice yearly.
